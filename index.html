<h2>Leafier is a Bukkit Server Panel with all the features included! No holds barred and no handicaps!</h2>
<p>Leafier may not be the first web-based server panel, but it packs more punch than the next leading competitior. Leafier is a new way for administrators to reach out to their community in ways that they've never had before. All you need is a minecraft server, a Web Server, and a MySQL Database. That's it!</p>
<br />
<h2 id="why">What does Leafier do?</h2>
<p>The leafier panel is meant to be used by not only admins and mods, but the regular player as well! The system offers a fully-built, fully functional site for the server including: a Homepage, a Stats page, a Ban Appeals page, and Forums (Coming Soon!). Leafier aims to create a panel that is generally used by the entire community rather than the staff for administrating the server.</p>
<br />
<h2>Bukkit-compatible!</h2>
<p>Leafier is meant to work along-side an already running Bukkit/Craftbukkit server and is used as an addon for this functionality. You can continue to run your server as-is along with the Leafier control panel.</p>
<br />
<h2>Hey! Contribute! We're Open Source!</h2>
<p>Because of Bukkit's licensing, Leafier is an open-source project that anyone can contribute to. Come visit us on EsperNet in #leafier if you want to help develop Leafier! (irc.esper.net #leafier)</p>
<br />
<h2 id="dnld">Download Leafier!</h2>
<p>Currently, Leafier is in Alpha status and is not open to stable downloads. If you want to check out some dev builds (Which is use-at-your-own-risk) you can check out our <a href="https://www.github.com/Leafier">Github for more info</a>.</p>
